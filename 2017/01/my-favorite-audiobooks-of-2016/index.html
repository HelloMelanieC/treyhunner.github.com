<div class="entry-content"><p>I set a goal of listening to 40 audiobooks in 2016.  I met that goal, but just barely.  I finished exactly 40 books and one of them I actually read the old fashioned way&hellip; as an e-book!  (Philip Morgan really needs to record an audiobook of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25754062-the-positioning-manual-for-technical-firms">The Positioning Manual</a>.)</p>

<p>I try to listen to a diverse set of books every year: I want to end my year having read books from different categories and genres and from authors with different backgrounds and writing styles.</p>

<p>I wrote about my favorite audiobooks I read in <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/my-favorite-audiobooks-of-2015/">2015</a> and <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2014/12/top-6-books-of-2014/">2014</a>.  Now I&rsquo;m going to attempt the same thing for 2016.  This task is always difficult because many of these books are very different from each other so I&rsquo;m not comparing apples to apples.  But I&rsquo;m going to try my best to pick my top 6.</p>

<p>The full list of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/29459515">books I read in 2016 is available on my Goodreads page</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Success and Luck</h3>

<p>This book was written by an economist, but you don&rsquo;t need to know anything at all about economics to appreciate most of it.  The book is strangely (though conveniently) split into two parts: the first two-thirds of the book are very different from the last one-third.</p>

<p>During the first two-thirds of the book, Robert Frank describes the role of luck in our lives.  I believe the world view he describes can result in increased humility and happiness; it&rsquo;s a mental model of the world which encourages gratitude for your life&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p>The last one-third of the book describes a tax policy that makes quite a bit of sense once you&rsquo;ve embraced this world view.  If not you&rsquo;re into economics, feel free to skim or skip this part.  I found it pretty interesting and quite worthwhile considering it&rsquo;s only one-third of a fairly short book.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical of meritocracies, self-made people, and the idea that &ldquo;you can make it if you try&rdquo;.  If you do not share this particular brand of skepticism but you&rsquo;re curious about the reasons behind my views, read this book.  It does a great job of coherently expressing certain thoughts I&rsquo;ve had, but never been able to verbalize.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/221484/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by the author, Robert H. Frank</p>

<h3>2. Make it Stick</h3>

<p>My biggest career transition so far has been moving from consultant to trainer: as of mid-2015, I teach for a living.  I used to solve business problems that involved writing code, but now I focus on solving business problems that involve teaching others to write code.  I picked up Make it Stick in an effort to improve my teaching style.</p>

<p>This is one of the first books I&rsquo;ve read on pedagogy.  The book covered a lot of ground.  The authors consist of a writer (Peter C. Brown) and two cognitive scientists (Henry L. Roediger III and Mark A. McDaniel).  Together, they&rsquo;ve made a coherent book consisting of actionable advice based in research.  That&rsquo;s the big distinguishing feature of this book: it&rsquo;s research summed up for the masses.</p>

<p>This book covers the growth mindset, active retrieval, interleaved practice, spaced practice, elaboration, and other topics I&rsquo;ve forgotten the names of.  While reading this book, I frequently had ideas about how I could improve my training style.  I plan to reread this book again in 2017 as I actively incorporate ideas from this book into my training courses.</p>

<h3>3. The Brain Audit</h3>

<p>I believe this is the first audiobook I&rsquo;ve listened to twice.  I listened to it early in the year while on a family vacation and then listened to it a few months later while struggling to apply some of the ideas from this book to my business.</p>

<p>This is not just a business book.  I&rsquo;ve found this book valuable when promoting my Python chats, tweeting about charitable and non-profit events, and even writing blog posts.</p>

<p>The Brain Audit really changed the way I look at my business, my writing, and sales &amp; marketing in general.  Most importantly, it included a ton of actionable advice.  Sean D&#8217;Souza does give some general advice but he definitely gets very specific with some of his advice, which I really appreciated.</p>

<h3>4. How to Be Black</h3>

<p>I read this book before realizing that I&rsquo;ve seen Baratunde participating in the CodeNewbies Twitter chats.</p>

<p>I did not know what this book was about when I picked it up and the book started as a satirical instruction manual of sorts which both confused and amused me.  The majority of the book was a memoir punctuated by life lessons and questions answered by a panel of &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The book pokes fun at the notion of categorizing people by blackness, but it does so while staying grounded in the reality of our race-aware world.  The asides between Baratunde&rsquo;s story included groan-worthy truths, ideas pushed to ridiculous ends, and a lot of humor wrapped around both light and heavy subjects.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12959743-how-to-be-black">How to Be Black</a> by Baratunde Thurston</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/96254/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by the author, Baratunde Thurston</p>

<h3>5. The Art of Asking</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m likely biased in my enjoyment for this book by the fact that I like Amanda Palmer&rsquo;s music and I appreciated watching interviews and talks from her before reading her book.</p>

<p>This is not a self help book: this is really more of a themed memoir.  I really enjoyed hearing Amanda Palmer&rsquo;s story and I especially enjoyed hearing her read her own work.  She narrates very well and the occasional musical interludes made the book even more special to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20980987-the-art-of-asking-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-let-people-hel">The Art of Asking</a> by Amanda Palmer</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/178890/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by the author, Amanda Palmer</p>

<h3>6. The Beautiful Struggle</h3>

<p>This is non-fiction, but the scenes stuck with me like it was fiction.  Ta-Nehisi Coates&#8217; told the story of his childhood beautifully.  This was very well-written and the audiobook was well-narrated.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784926-the-beautiful-struggle">The Beautiful Struggle</a> by Ta-Nehisi Coates</p>

<p><a href="http://www.downpour.com/catalog/product/view/id/224786/">DRM-free audiobook</a> read by J.D. Jackson</p>

<h3>More books</h3>

<p>After compiling this list I realized a few interesting things:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the books are available DRM-free (this wasn&rsquo;t true for my 2014 and 2015 lists)</li>
<li>Most of the books are narrated by the authors, which is slightly uncommon</li>
<li>All of these books are non-fiction</li>
</ul>


<p>Usually I mix in some fiction, so I&rsquo;ll recommend some of the fiction I read now.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for historical fiction try <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14891.A_Tree_Grows_in_Brooklyn">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230996.Wild_Ginger">Wild Ginger</a>, or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18749.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun">Half of a Yellow Sun</a>.  If you&rsquo;re looking for science fiction or fantasy try <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115969.Overclocked">Overclocked</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14497.Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a>, or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one">Ready Player One</a>.</p>

<p>Now for this year&rsquo;s reading goal!  I&rsquo;m going to be a little less ambitious this year.  I plan to listen to more long audiobooks, so I&rsquo;ve lowered my reading goal drastically.  In 2017 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/7102421">I plan to read 24 books</a>, all of them likely audiobooks.  Feel free to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29459515-trey-hunner">follow me on Goodreads</a> if you&rsquo;d like to keep up with my reading habits.</p>
