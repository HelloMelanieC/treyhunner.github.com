Below are some open source projects I am involved with.

## EditorConfig

I use [EditorConfig][] in all of my own projects.  You should too.

## Tmuxstart

I use [tmuxstart][] for my tmux sessions.  It greatly improves my workflow.

## names

I use [names][] to generate random names for testing.

## Django Projects

I help maintain multiple Django projects.

- [django-authorizenet][]
- [django-email-log][]
- [django-localflavor][]
- [django-model-utils][]
- [django-relatives][]
- [django-simple-history][]

## jQuery Django Formset

[jquery-django-formset][] allows easy management of dynamic Django formsets.

## dotfiles

I host my [dotfiles][] on Github.

## invoices

The [invoices][] project is a LaTeX class for creating print-friendly invoices.

## resume

The [resume][] project is a LaTeX class for creating resumes.  I created this
after I got sick of creating resumes in word processors.

## jQuery Form Restrict

The [jquery-formrestrict][] project can be used to restrict form input.  I
originally made this project to replace the broken jQuery Alphanumeric plugin.
I rarely use this project now.
