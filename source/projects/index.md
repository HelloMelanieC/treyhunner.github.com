Below are some open source projects I am involved with.

## EditorConfig

I use [EditorConfig][] in all of my own projects.  You should too.

## Tmuxstart

I use [tmuxstart][] for my tmux sessions.  It greatly improves my workflow.

## names

I use [names][] to generate random names for testing.

## invoices

The [invoices][] project is a LaTeX class for creating print-friendly invoices.

## resume

The [resume][] project is a LaTeX class for creating resumes.  I created this
after I got sick of creating resumes in word processors.

## jQuery Form Restrict

The [jquery-formrestrict][] project can be used to restrict form input.  I
originally made this project to replace the broken jQuery Alphanumeric plugin.
I rarely use this project now.
