## "Just Mercy" by Bryan Stevenson

#### Content

In this book, Bryan Stevenson retells stories surrounding his founding of the Equal Justice Initiative as well as some of the cases he worked on.  He focuses primarily on the case of Walter McMillian.

The compassion and hope in this book make it an easier read, but it's still crushing at times.  While reading, I frequently found myself mulling around my apartment in anger, sadness, or quiet contemplation.  I had given little thought to the inner-workings of our justice system before reading this book.

#### Narration

I really enjoyed Bryan Stevenson's self-narration.  He isn't a particularly animated orator, but he tells a story well and I never caught myself dozing off.

## "Little Brother" by Cory Doctorow

#### Content

This read like a modern 1984.  The science fiction was minimal and the reactions of the public and the government felt fairly believable.

#### Narration

I enjoyed Kirby Heyborne's narration and character voices.  In comparison, Wil Wheaton's reading of Homeland was animated, but he pronounced some names strangely.  I liked Cory Doctorow's reading of Lawful Interception the best out of the three books in the series.

## "Lesterland" by Lawrence Lessig

#### Content

Lawrence Lessig explains a core problem in our democratic republic: the way we fund political campaigns.  For a summary of the book, checkout his [TED talk][lesterland video] on the same topic.

#### Narration

I enjoyed Lawrence Lessig's self-narration.  It was like listening to an extended version of his TED Lesterland talk.

## "The Martian" by Andy Weir

#### Content

Astronaut Mark Watney struggles to survive on Mars after a dust storm nearly kills him and causes his crew to evacuate after they assume he died.  Watney's ingenuity, luck, and him sense of humor made this an enjoyable read.  The science sounded mostly plausible also.

#### Narration

I enjoyed R. C. Brady narration of Mark Watney's dark humor.
