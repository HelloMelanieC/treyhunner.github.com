## "Just Mercy" by Bryan Stevenson

#### Content

In this book, Bryan Stevenson retells stories surrounding his founding of the Equal Justice Initiative as well as some of the cases he worked on.  He focuses primarily on the case of Walter McMillian.

The compassion and hope in this book make it an easier read, but it's still crushing at times.  While reading, I frequently found myself mulling around my apartment in anger, sadness, or quiet contemplation.  I had given little thought to the inner-workings of our justice system before reading this book.

#### Narration

I really enjoyed Bryan Stevenson's self-narration.  He isn't a particularly animated orator, but he tells a story well and I never caught myself dozing off.

I enjoyed Lawrence Lessig's self-narration.  It was like listening to an extended version of his TED Lesterland talk.
