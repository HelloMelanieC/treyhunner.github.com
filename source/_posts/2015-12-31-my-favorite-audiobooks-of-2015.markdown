## Whistling Vivaldi: And Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us

If you help lead an organization of people, you should read this book or at least read a good summary of it.

One takeaway: a "colorblind" environment is a racist environment.

## Twelve Years a Slave

Very well written autobiography.  Very clear and very event-filled.  I had less trouble keeping track of the characters than in much of the fiction I read.

I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm hoping it's as good as the book.

## The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion

I have heard a lot of criticism of this book, partially due to its use of the terms "liberal" and "conservative".

My takeaway: morals are not absolute and we tend to categorize ourselves based on moral pillars we hold sacred or ignore.  It is difficult but important to empathizing with those who recognize different moral pillars than you.

## Americanah

The main character, Ifemelu, is a complex individual and I really enjoyed hearing her story.  She she struggles with romance, family, and identity.  I especially enjoyed Adjoa Andoh's audiobook narration of this book.

## The New Jim Crow

Do you watch Law and Order? Take a break for a few episodes and read this book instead.

This book discusses the effects of the war on drugs, rising incarceration rates, affirmative action, color-blindness, and a number of other issues.

Drugs, jail, judges, justice, and much more.

I learned quite a few eye-opening facts while reading. Here's a couple: police officers can discriminate based on race so long as it is not the only determining factor of their actions (e.g. "I arrested him because he was black and wearing a hooded sweatshirt") and judges have retired due to their unwillingness to continue obeying mandatory minimum sentence laws.

I do wish the data behind this discussion was a little more prevalent in this book. Statistics were definitely discussed multiple times, but they were mostly mentioned in passing and infrequently reiterated.

## How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America

## Reading Lolita in Tehran

This was a meandering walk through Iranian culture, politics, and life next to a stream of twentieth century literary discussions. Authors, novels, and characters from twentieth century literature frequently evoked reflections upon the state of Iranian life.

There were at least a few times I realized I may be missing some context due to my unfamiliarity with many of the authors and works discussed.

## The Handmaid's Tale

Some people call this book "science fiction".  I'd call it fiction set in the future.  This was a relatable future.

## For the Win

This book has less technology focus than Little Brother and Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom and less government/corporate corruption than Little Brother and Pirate Cinema. The primary focus is abuse of workers around the world and unionization.

My favorite books list from last year included Little Brother.  After further reflection on that series, I would warn readers that the main character of Little Brother is somewhat stereotypical and obnoxious.

## The Wordy Shipmates

This book was packed with information.  I honestly didn't understand much of this book, but I really enjoyed it regardless.


## Between the World and Me

## The Truth is a Cave in the Black Mountains

Very short read.  Great audiobook.

## Information Doesn't Want to Be Free: Laws for the Internet Age
